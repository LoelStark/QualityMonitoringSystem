# BrainSteady Tech – Quality Monitoring System

An AI-powered Quality Monitoring System designed to support modern manufacturing environments, with a focus on predictive maintenance, risk analysis, and real-time machinery insights.

This project serves as a frontend interface and conceptual dashboard for an intelligent quality monitoring platform aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing unplanned downtime.

# 🚀 Project Overview

The Quality Monitoring System provides a web-based interface that simulates how manufacturers can:

## Insert and manage machinery data

Monitor equipment health and quality metrics

Perform AI-driven risk and failure analysis

Visualize stored data for informed decision-making

The system is designed with scalability in mind and reflects real-world manufacturing challenges, particularly within developing and industrializing markets.

✨ Features

Smart Data Insertion
Add machinery records with structured validation.

Quality Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time system status indicators and logs.

Risk & Predictive Analysis
Designed to integrate AI models for early fault detection and maintenance forecasting.

Modern UI
Futuristic, glassmorphism-inspired interface with responsive design.

🧠 AI Integration (Planned / Conceptual)

The system is designed to integrate with leading AI models, including:

Google Gemini

Meta Llama

OpenAI GPT-4

These models can be used for:

Predictive maintenance

Anomaly detection

Risk scoring

Natural-language explanations of machine health

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla)

Google Fonts (Orbitron, Roboto)

Note: This repository currently represents the frontend interface and system concept. Backend services and AI pipelines are intended future extensions.
